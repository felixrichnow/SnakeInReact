## Run the snake game

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

And there will be a snake game at your browser:
http://localhost:3000/

The whole project is done in React and uses a custom React hook by Dan Abramov. I don't claime to own anything here and I definitely haven't written any of the code myself. The only difference I've done in my project is change the color of the snake and added so that the snake's speed goes up as you eat more apples.
